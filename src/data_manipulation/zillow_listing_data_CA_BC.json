Step onto the sand from your spacious front patio, and enjoy panoramic ocean, beach and sunset views from the primary suite\u2019s balcony. A shingled-cottage exterior creates a welcoming ambiance at the seaside home, which showcases a seamless open-concept main level that opens to the front patio and features a living room with fireplace and built-in cabinetry, a spacious dining room, and a custom kitchen with black stone countertops, a hand-carved island with butcher-block top, white bead-board cabinetry with illuminated glass uppers, a pantry with a custom French door, and a suite of top-of-the-line appliances from Sub-Zero, Wolf and Dacor. Wood flooring graces the entire residence and complements impeccably crafted millwork, including crown molding, wainscoting and custom vanities. Upscale nautical elements complement the beachfront setting, and an elegant staircase, skylights, custom tilework, and premium paint and wall treatments embellish throughout. Three ensuite bedrooms and three- and one-half baths are revealed in a two-level floorplan of approximately 2,538 square feet. All bedrooms are crowned with vaulted ceilings, and the ocean-view primary suite presents a sitting area with fireplace, two walk-in closets with furniture-caliber built-ins, and an opulent bath with separate vanities, a separate shower and a jetted tub. The home\u2019s location is without compare. Not only does it open directly to the beach, it is just a few blocks from the Balboa Fun Zone, the Balboa Island ferry terminal, Peninsula Park and the Balboa Pier. Nationally acclaimed schools serve the community, and Fashion Island, Newport Coast, Crystal Cove, Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach are enviably convenient.Show more11 dayson Zillow|2,716views|89saves|Travel timesCarTake a tour with a buyer's agentIn-personVideo chatSelect a preferred timeChevron LeftPreviousTUEJan 31WEDFeb 1THUFeb 2FRIFeb 3Chevron RightNext1:00 pm1:30 pm2:00 pm2:30 pm3:00 pm3:30 pm4:00 pm4:30 pm5:00 pm5:30 pm6:00 pm6:30 pm7:00 pmRequest this timeFacts and featuresInterior detailsBedrooms and bathroomsBedrooms: 3Bathrooms: 4Full bathrooms: 31/2 bathrooms: 1Main level bathrooms: 1BathroomFeatures: Bathtub, Shower, Closet in bathroom, Double Sinks In Master Bath, Dual shower heads (or Multiple), Separate tub and shower, Walk-in showerKitchenFeatures: Kitchen Island, Kitchen Open to Family RoomFlooringFlooring: WoodHeatingHeating features: Forced AirCoolingCooling features: Central AirAppliancesAppliances included: Freezer, Gas Oven, Gas Cooktop, Microwave, Range Hood, Refrigerator, Warming DrawerLaundry features: Laundry Room, Upper LevelInterior FeaturesDoor features: French DoorsWindow features: BlindsInterior features: Balcony, Beamed Ceilings, Built-in Features, Crown Molding, Recessed Lighting, Kitchen, Laundry, Living Room, Master Bathroom, Master Bedroom, Walk-In Closet(s), Eating Area In Dining Room, Eat-in KitchenOther interior featuresCommon walls with other units/homes: No Common WallsTotal interior livable area: 2,583 sqftFireplace features: Living Room, Master BedroomVirtual tour: View virtual tourProperty detailsParkingTotal spaces: 2Parking features: Direct AccessGarage spaces: 2Covered spaces: 2PropertyLevels: TwoPool features: NoneSpa features: NoneExterior features: LightingView description: PanoramicWaterfront features: Beach Access, Ocean Access, Ocean Front, Ocean Side of Freeway, Ocean Side Of Highway 1Has waterview: YesWaterview: Coastline,Ocean,Water,White WaterLotLot size: 2,400 sqftLot features: Front YardOther property informationParcel number: 04808216Special conditions: StandardConstruction detailsType and styleHome type: SingleFamilyProperty subType: Single Family ResidenceConditionNew construction: NoYear built: 2001Utilities / Green Energy DetailsUtilityElectric information: StandardSewer information: Public SewerWater information: PublicCommunity and Neighborhood DetailsCommunityCommunity features: BikingLocationRegion: Newport BeachSubdivision: Balboa Peninsula (Residential) (BALP)HOA and financial detailsOther financial informationBuyer agency compensation: 2.500%See more facts and featuresServices availability"

This 4-bedroom floor plan (with a main main floor and 2nd floor suite) gives buyers the chance to fix up/redesign and save PLUS multiple ADU (accessory dwelling unit) options for additional income! The main level has a 3-bedroom layout (the 3rd bedroom is being used as a dining room and has been partially opened up and could easily be converted back). One of the bedrooms serves as one of TWO PRIMARY BEDROOMS with a private bathroom. The hall bathroom was remodeled in the last 2 years. The upstairs suite has so many options -\u00a0 it could work for multigenerational living or an in-law suite... It could even be reimagined into a private separate studio for rental income. With a spa-sized bathroom and giant walk-in closet, consider adding a private entrance or kitchenette in this giant space! The oversized secluded yard is a great space for large parties and has room for a separate ADU as well. Trees are being planted behind the home by the city to enhance the greenery. Plenty of room for a pool too! The potential is limitless - other homes have opened up the kitchen/living area for a more modern concept. There is a bonus addition (not permitted and not included in the square footage) that provides additional living space too. Great location on a quiet, private cul-de-sac with no thru traffic. RV access. Lemon tree. Parking in driveway for 4 cars. Direct access garage. Trane furnace. Schools and parks are located within the neighborhood and easy freeway access nearby.
